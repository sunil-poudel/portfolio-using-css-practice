This is a small project related to making a portfolio using plain CSS.
The project is not programmed using javascript or typescript. It is just a test of my knowledge
on CSS, so that I can play around with basic CSS features.

I have utilized concepts of animation, flexbox, grids and the project
is optimized for mobile devices as well, so it's responsive.
